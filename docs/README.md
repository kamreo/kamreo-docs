# About the kamreo docs 

> Useful docs are collection of topics and solutions, that I need to look for systematically. To speed up the process I put all the content here and gather everything in one place. 

# Docsify 

> You can see the docs here (docs for docs :D): https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart
> You can run local server by `docsify serve docs`
